    <p>Here are some suggestions for GA4 metrics and dimensions for an open-source software project’s website, along with useful ways to visualize them. The key is to align tracking with the primary goals of such a site: attracting users, facilitating downloads/usage, providing documentation, and fostering community/contributions.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Custom Events are Key:</strong> GA4’s automatic tracking is good, but you <em>must</em> set up custom events (e.g., via Google Tag Manager) to track crucial actions like downloads, clicks to GitHub/issue tracker, etc.</li>
<li>
<strong>Mark Conversions:</strong> Identify the most important events (like <code>download</code>, <code>view_repository</code>) and mark them as conversions in the GA4 interface. This makes reporting on key goals much easier.</li>
<li>
<strong>Filters &amp; Segments:</strong> Use GA4’s “Explore” section heavily. Create reports filtered by specific page paths (e.g., <code>/docs/</code>, <code>/blog/</code>) or user segments (e.g., users from specific countries, users who downloaded the software).</li>
