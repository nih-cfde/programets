index for a user. Each session from a unique user will get its own incremental index starting from 1 for the first session. Subsequent sessions do not change previous session indices. For example, if a user has 4 sessions to the website, sessionCount for that user will have 4 distinct values of '1' through '4'. #> 3                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 The number of days elapsed since users last visited the property, used to calculate user loyalty. #> 4                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           The value provided when defining custom user segments for the property. #> 5                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Randomly assigned users tag to allow A/B testing and splitting of remarketing lists.

This value is also corrected for daylight savings time. If the timezone follows daylight savings time, there will be an apparent bump in the number of sessions during the changeover hour (e.g., between 1:00 and 2:00) for the day per year when that hour repeats. A corresponding hour with zero sessions will occur at the opposite changeover. (Google Analytics does not track user time more precisely than hours.) #> 249                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Returns the minutes, between 00 and 59, in the hour. #> 250                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    The index for a month in the specified date range.

a request which has the dimensions ga:acquisitionTrafficChannel/ga:acquisitionSource/ga:acquisitionMedium/ga:acquisitionCampaign. It represents the number of users in the cohorts who are acquired through the current channel/source/medium/campaign. For example, for ga:acquisitionTrafficChannel=Direct, it represents the number users in the cohort, who were acquired directly. If none of these mentioned dimensions are present, then its value is equal to ga:cohortTotalUsers. #> 462
