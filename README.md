The goal of programets is to gather metrics from iCite, Google
Analytics, GitHub, and other sources to help assess the impact of your
NIH Project on the broader research community.

## Installation

You can install the development version of programets from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("nih-cfde/programets")
```

## Example Usage

Query the NIH RePORTER:

``` r
library(programets)

proj_info <- get_core_project_info(c("u24ca289073"))
proj_info |> colnames()

Tag your GitHub repositories with NIH Core Project Numbers to download
common metrics:

``` r
df <- get_github_by_topic(c("u24ca289073"))
#> ! No GitHub token provided. Running without authentication
